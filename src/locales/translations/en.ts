        description: "Hello üëã I started my real adventure with programming at the end of 2017 when I started my studies. The first programming languages I learned were: C ++, HTML / CSS / JS. During my studies, I chose the Mobile Systems and Applications specialization, where I started to develop towards Java. I liked this language so much that until recently, i.e. until Java 15, I had to know about all the implemented novelties. Along the way, I got to know many technologies and frameworks that interest me. I have always liked the simplicity of writing JS code, and at the same time frustrated me that it is a dynamically typed language. My approach to this language changed when I got to know Typescript technology. This environment makes me a great JS or Node.js programmer and I am currently developing in this direction.",
